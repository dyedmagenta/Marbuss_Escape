			story = _"Our story begins in 883 YW. It takes place in the far north, where all the dates stopped to mean anything to anybody. Violence, blood and damnation. Wrestling competitions and drinking sprees between raids. Women spread their legs at bonfires and let their partners shag them. Yes, I am talking about orcs."

			story = _"Many years have passed since the time orcs intimidated elves, humans and dwarves. Many years have passed since they found the courage to venture in the Wesnoth land. Many years have passed since the time they were filthy rich."

		[/part]
		[part]
			story = _"Plenty of battles were fought, on one occasion the orcs conquered new lands, on the other time they came back home with new wounds. Other realms, as strong as the orcs, started to whet their swords. When after the next unsuccessful attack of the bloodthirsty army the orcs retreated deep into their lands, the elves followed them."

			story = _"Humans, as well as dwarves, willingly joined the retaliation. Year after year, the orcs became only camps of refugees separated by trade routes. Some tribes joined the Northern Alliance, in which they were forced to accept human rules over many years. The others were fighting and were destroyed after several battles against dwarves or elves."

			story = _"Human trading posts took place of orcish smelters. Only the clans that lived deep in the north survived the forages of other nations. Amongst them, there was a small clan of Marbus. A clan too small to have a name, a history, or a future."

It is a trading post dealing between Northern Alliance and Wesnoth. And even if they want to get rid of us, why did they not send somebody of a higher rank than you?"}

		{MESSAGE Kochan () () _"I don't like it, my cousin. If this human is telling the truth, something must have flushed the city's dwellers out. Way off in the distance I can see their women and children. Marbus, they are not an army, they are refugees!"}
		{MESSAGE Marbus () () _"Refugees or an army... we cannot surrender Bag'not to them, either way. It is our homeland. And as its inhabitants we must defend it! Arke netu Karash!"}
