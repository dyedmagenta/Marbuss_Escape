First, he ordered to set a huge camp, take the grindstones and repair workshops out of the wagons, dig out the holes, fortify the broken walls and places which could serve as defence points. Everyone had to be fully able and perfectly prepared for the coming of the King of Gon. The preparations lasted four days. On the fifth day Beatrice's raven arrived. The message was clear - the undead armies attacked the southern defence lines. The enemy forced turned out much bigger that it'd been expected. The risk of loss was high and it was of utmost priority to call and defeat the King of Gon as as fast as possible."

Piercing silence fell at the foot of the Mountain of Destiny, and neither even a single cough nor a dropped goblin arrow broke it. After that, the Great Sovereign blew the Gjallarhorn , and its echo reverberated around. It might seem that the sound was heard in all the northern lands: Beatrice could hear it while watching the battle from her balcony of her Princess Tower, the saurians on the marshes could hear it as well while defending themselves against the undead, the dwarves could hear it, too, in the farthest corners of Knalga. The horn's sound made the corpses of the residents of the Celadon City tremble. The whole north stood in total silence for that moment, listening to the strange and terrific melody of the Gjallarhorn."
