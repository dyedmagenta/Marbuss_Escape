Even though it happened neither without doubts, nor without sacrifice, in the beating hearts of orcs the warfare and the lust of survival have inflamed. The warriors saw that even the most dreadful demons may be defeated."

  			story=_"They managed to do it only thanks to the help of Saurians. When years ago, sovereign Gewold refused them help and shelter, everyone was expecting the war. In the far north the great battle between the orcish clans and Saurians was supposed to fire. Two kinds of blood would flood the dry hills and the swampy marches. However, this battle never happened."

So that he couldn't see standing unsure reptiles, full of insecurity and doubt. Next time no ally would come to rescue them."

			story=_"The way to Sunek Dal was exhausting and burdensome, it decreased the Marbus' crowd by a considerable amount of women and elderly people. The blizzard was so powerful that the road few meters in front of orcs was completely invisible. They had to trust wolves. Apart from this, what did wait for them in Sunek Dal? Hot meal, warm beds and root beer? Or maybe a fratricidal fight for the rest of eatable? Although Marbus didn't know it, his wildly running blood gave him a feeling of incoming battle."
