 			story = _"Death of the King of Gon was as prominent for the whole North as the usage of Gjallarhorn. In a split second all spectres dissipated in midair and undead skeletons crumbled into piles of weapons and bones. A lot has been sacrificed, but the living won in this battle."

 		[part]
 			story = _"The Great Sovereign leaded the Horde to last remaining cities of the Northern Alliance. The King of Gon wasn't lying when he said about the fall of southern defence line. Only a few detachments and groups of deserters remained. The North was shattered and Beatrice was taking care of its remains. During the battle she was surrounded by twelve liches, and she had to fight them with her magic. By surviving, she once again proved the power of elvish shydes."

 			story = _"A time to rebuild has came. When undeads were gone, roads to southern lands became open. Instantly emissaries were sent to Kingdom of Wesnoth, Elsensefar and the Wesmere Forest. The help came, and dwarves opened their vaults and generously payed all who took part in rebuilding the North. It seemed like the Knalga isn't going to close itself underground from external problems ever again."

 		[part]
 			story = _"In regard to Marbus, he engaged himself in rebuilding the North with all his might. In short time the Great Horde gained respect and later, even friendship of other nations. Even if they had a big advantage over them, they didn't use that to deal the devastating blow to the North, moreover, they even helped it stand on its own. They repented for past sins, changed their fate."
			background="story/landscape-castle.jpg"
		[/part]
 		[part]
 			story = _"Under the leadership of the Great Sovereign the orcs populated the North and maintained alliance with all their citizens. This state of matter lasted for five years. The Great Horde in this time dissolved into clans. All of them were subordinate to Marbus and his ideals. Until the time when on the east, close to the border with Elvish Jarls, Gewold came to power."

 		[part]
 			story = _"First rumours about mutiny in orcish clans were ignored by northern lands, that once again became great powers. Later though, the threat became clear. Marbus was expected to crush the rebels and once again prove that his reasons are good and honest. Without waiting for the things to develop, he gathered his forces and marched east, to see the mutiny with his own eyes."

		{MESSAGE Gewold () () _"Marbus! Finally! Could you believe that we waited here for you? The Great Sovereign came! Boys, attension, he's going to make his offended face and start talking about how elves are wonderful! Anyone wants to listen about this elvish witch's graces? Or maybe about that water hag that follows him everywhere? Which one are you going to tell us about today, the Great Sovereign?"}
		{MESSAGE Marbus () () _"The hell, Gewold! You attacked Elvish Jarls' lands, incited half of the clans into mutiny, and then openly opposed everything we tried to create. What came into you? Was it that bad living in peace? I provided you home, food, safety! You despise all of that? Only to butcher someone, that's what you want, right? To feed your bloodlust!"}

Nobody except you believes that this alliance is going to last, that we can live together. Even Aidala, your mistress... She follows you even tho she knows it isn't going to succeed! Am I right?"}

		{MESSAGE Gewold () () _"My mutiny is necessary, Marbus. You lead us here and I'm glad you did. But you made a mistake. When we won over the King of Gon, you should have lead us to victory, and now... it's too late. Dwarves, elves, humans... They are powerfull, united again. We cannot defead them. Even if they won't attack us, we'll still be pushovers, don't you see it?"}
		{MESSAGE Marbus () () _"No, I don't! I don't believe, that Beatrice would betray us. That she would let it happen. I trust them. And I ask you to trust me. Drop your sword and let me lead you this path."}
		{MESSAGE Gewold () () _"I cannot, Marbus... It's not about Beatrice. There are others... Like those, who killed Kochan. There are plenty of them. You don't see them, because you're going around in communities where nobody lets himself to show animosity openly, but we... We see the truth, Marbus. And the truth is that, it's time that we should choose a better sovereign."}
