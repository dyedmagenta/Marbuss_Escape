 			story = _"Everyone gave in to the heroic mood, and the representatives of all the races danced, sang, ate and drank, boated about their courage and patted each other proudly on their backs. This state of affairs didn’t last for long. The undead threat was still real, and when it became clear that they were hunting for the orcs, numerous elves, humans and dwarves, all wanted them to be gone as soon as possible. If it hadn’t been for Beatrice who was able to restrain the anger of the Elven Jarls and the noble houses of the Northern Alliance, unarguably there would have been a battle."

 			story = _"While no one allowed for open hostility, unfavourable glances and words were harassing the Great Horde all the time. The orcs tolerated them patiently, as they were happy with the warmth of the bonfires, food and the access to medicine. However, Marbus was aware that this would not last forever, and Gewold and the rest of the elders constantly reminded him of that. The key aspect was for the Horde to defeat the King of Gon and to leave."

 			story = _"Two weeks after the battle, Marbus and his army were standing in front of the cave entrance where the Gjallarhorn was to be hidden. Not expecting many dangers and not wanting to lead too many troops in the cave, the Great Sovereign assembled his most trusted warriors and set forth into the darkness."

In the end they lost, and the mage fled. He was killed by the beardmen in a forgotten tunnel, where his ghost haunts, and the amulet awaits to be found. At least that is what the legend says."}
