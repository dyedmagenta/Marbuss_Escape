 			story = _"The reckless ride of Kochan and the retreat to the Norther Alliance’s army enabled the orcs to head north. Thus another mad escape through the unknown and hostile land began. Marbus was rushing at the front with his finest warriors. Behind him there was a long and scattered line of orcs once called the Great Horde. Now, they looked no better than poor and war-shattered refugees that posed threat to no one."

 			story = _"Minutes became hours, and the hours became days. The ones who had horses could afford a moment of luxury while sleeping in a saddle. The other set provisional camps, hid in the bush and promised to follow the march once they had a nap. It was clear that at least half of them would not return. A lot of them desired for a stop, but Marbus continuously pressed north, because he saw the only hope for his people in it."
			background="story/landscape-hills-01.jpg"
		[/part]
		[part]
 			story = _"During the escape, he managed to tell his advisors all about the events in the catacombs of the stronghold. There he came across ancient shamanistic scriptures telling about the Wild Gon, a huge army of the undead which awakened once in a thousand years to torment the orcish race for their countless sins and plundering nature. The only way to destroy the army was to defeat the King of Gon. As it turned out, it was not an easy task, since he was in the heart of the undead army, inaccessible for the living."
			background="story/landscape-hills-01.jpg"
		[/part]
		[part]
 			story = _"Yet there has been a way to summon the King of Gon and order him to have the final battle with the living. In order to do that, Marbus had to obtain the Gjallarhorn. The situation was even more complicated, because the artifact was kept in enchanted ancient orcish caves. It was placed there over a thousand years ago, after the last raid of the King of Gon. The shamen did not expect that the territory where their cave had been would be in the elvish hands."

		{MESSAGE Gewold () () _"The undead may not move well through the woods, but you forget about one important thing ... We do not move well either! Besides, this place reeks of elves!"}
		{MESSAGE Aidala () () _"This Person did not expect you to be the first to shudder at the thought of the elves."}
		{MESSAGE Gewold () () _"Most of my scars have been made by the elvish steel. I would gladly break a few skulls and taste their flesh, but I fear for the Great Horde. We are broken, and if we thin our ranks even more, the elves will slaughter us like ducks."}
		{MESSAGE Krull () () _"Elf meat good. Good with onion. My old woman always cook in cauldron, stir and stir, and it come away from bone. Healthy for childrens."}
		{MESSAGE Marbus () () _"We have no choice. We need to get to the caves where the Gjallarhorn is. As for the elves, look north! It looks like we are going to face them now!"}
		{MESSAGE LordDirack () () _"I’ve gathered the main forces of the Northern Alliance. I’ve come to stop the undead raiders and protect our land. It is only a several dozen of kilometres to our capital from here. We have to hold our position at all costs!"}
		{MESSAGE IrickHigh () () _"According to our arrangements, elvish jarls agreed to let me take care of their remaining troops. All the refugees are sent farther north where they are helped by the Northern Alliance and Knalga."}
		{MESSAGE LordDirack () () _"So the dwarves agreed to our terms and will help us in battle? It was hard to convince them ... Satisfying one clan means treading on three other clans’ toes."}
		{MESSAGE IrickHigh () () _"It’s true, but we got our own way. The old king abdicated, and Wilhelm the Iron Fist was crowned hastily yesterday. His regiment should be here soon. What is this? The undead? No... These are orcs! Strings on the bows!"}
		{MESSAGE LordDirack () () _"To be honest, the Northern Alliance is against open armed attacks, but ..."}
		{MESSAGE IrickHigh () () _"... they are the ones the undead are hunting for!"}
		{MESSAGE LordDirack () () _"So you’ve discovered the relation? Anyway, our speculations were true. All of the orcs from the north are being slaughtered. But we will discuss this later ... The most important thing now is protecting our land and slaughtering the orcs from the undead come after them!"}
		{MESSAGE Aidala () () _"This Person senses an incoming battle. There is a stench of death in the air."}
		{MESSAGE Gewold () () _"That would be it for the peaceful solutions. It’s time to attack, slaughter them all!"}
		{MESSAGE Marbus () () _"It’s true they do not approve of us, but their stubbornness might come in handy. If their commanders die, then the undead will flood the whole north, and it will be too late for us to be saved... No! Fight so that neither the Great Lord nor the Jarl die! And now ... Attack!"}
