 			story = _"The forces of dwarves and Northern Alliance have been vanquished, and Marbus' clan joined forces with residents of Gelu'Aben. Soon after that, they managed to dress their wounds, say goodbye to the dead and feed the hungry. The orcish elders decided to bring out the last supplies out of the granaries and a great feast was hold, with Marbus as a honoured guest. Everybody's happiness lasted the whole day. One day, in which they managed to forget about the winter, the hordes of undead and about the Northern Alliance running rampant."
 		[/part]
 		[part]
 			story = _"One day after the feast, there was a meeting arranged, which's reason was to solve all problems, which afflicted the orcish clans. Everybody with who the elders were still in touch with, came along. A proud, once great nation of orcs wasn't even able to fill half of the city. On the streets, women, oldsters and attenuated children were wandering around. Only here and there you could find a man with weapon, or a goblin, whittling arrows for another battle. Gelu'Aben was becoming a grave."
 		[/part]
 		[part]
 			story = _"On the meeting, twelve people came along: clans' representatives and the elders. Everybody tried to enforce his standpoint, and all of them based on one clear concept: to stay in the fortress and wait out. Only Marbus though, that this way the won't survive. After slamming his hand on the table and putting orcs in order, he managed to convince them, that all what awaits them here is death. Gewold was the first person to object Marbus: escape isn't an option, because where are they supposed to go?"
 		[/part]
 		[part]
			story = _"And then the elders spoke up: there was an abandoned fortress in the east, over the mountains. It was situated on mysterious Kalindoran Fields. There are supposed to be ancient orcish writings over there, which contain knowledge about how to survive such apocalypse. The whole plan seemed to be based on tales and myths, but in current situation no one could come up with a better solution. Also, nobody could figure out how to get through the mountains."
 		[/part]
 		[part]
			story = _"Marbus, who already decided to get on the Kalindor Fields, proposed to lead orcs through the dwarven tunnels. Although Gelu'Aben was within a stone's throw from them, no orc has crossed the enterance of dwarvish caverns for years. Once a warlike race, started to fear the power which Knalga has became."
 		[/part]
 		[part]
			story = _"A voting was started to decide about the future of all clans. Seven out of twelve agreed to go through the tunnels. The same seven has also agreed, that Marbus will become the new Great Suverein. Gewold was sitting in silence: he was oppose to both these decisions."
 		[/part]
 		[part]
			story = _"The next morning, the Great United Horde grabbed their torches and emblazed the city. After just one hour, once a great Gelu'Aben became a ruin. There was no return: only elves in the forests and soldiers of Northern Aliance watched, how black smoke furled upwards the city. It was to do so for a long time, asphyxiating these, who would approach the fortress. Meanwhile, Marbus took the Great Suvereign's banner and as the first descended beneath the ground, leading his brothers into the darkness of dwarven tunnels."

		{MESSAGE narrator () () _"At last, Marbus's horde strided into the dark and dump dwarven corridors. Last of the orcs: oldsters and women, who dragged little carts with belongings and food, as well as a small livestock, such as goats and chickens, left behind the pale light of dawn. Now, their path would only be brighted by torches and phosphorescing fungi, which grow here and there, effusing a nasty, acrid smell. That's how their journey through the deeps begins."}
		{MESSAGE Gewold () () _"Yuk! These mushrooms stink so terrible, that even our wargs start to yelp. I start to doubt in the point of our journey, Marbus. We are already going for few hours, and the tunnels are becoming narrower."}
		{MESSAGE Krull () () _"Shrooms stink and hurt. Hurt in belly. I eaten too much and now vomit."}
		{MESSAGE Emborgi () () _"This type of mushrooms shouldn't stink... It looks like even here, beneath the ground, nature starts to feel the results of what is happening on the surface. Thus take a good look, orcish warriors! This is the best evidence of how strong is the ghost, who runs rampant on these lands."}
		{MESSAGE Marbus () () _"Calm down, Gewold, or I will deem that you are becoming crusty due to the old age. There is no way back for us - we must move forward."}
		{MESSAGE Kochan () () _"I must admit, however, that I feel unease as well, cousin. And it's not just about the tunnels, but about the lack of any traces of dwarves. I believed that we will force our way to the other side over their corpses, having a precisely determined path. If we get lost here, then neither starts, nor winds, nor wolves... Nothing will show us the way."}
		{MESSAGE Krull () () _"Trolls been living here for years and ages. I and my sons know, how to walk in gloom, to find way. When you get lost, we will lead."}
		{MESSAGE Emborgi () () _"Can it be, that my blind eyes saw more, than yours? Seeing? You see, my kin isn't afraid of the darkness of this place. We will find a way, even if we will have to call our ancestors for assistance! And the ancestors of ours ancestors! And the ancestors of our ancestors' ancestors as well!"}
		{MESSAGE Marbus () () _"You see, then? We have nothing to be afraid of. Since when these undead appeared in the north, I feel like if an arcane force leadead us by the hand. Although it might be old' orcsess' superstition, I believe in the destiny. And death at this place isn't our destiny."}
		{MESSAGE Gewold () () _"Silence! Calm down these wargs right now! Can you hear that? It's a sough of a river."}
		{MESSAGE Kochan () () _"Thank forefathers! We will replenish our canteens and drink to our's fill, provided the waters is drinkable. It's also possible, that by the river will be found a dwarven settlement, so have yours swords ready."}
		{MESSAGE Marbus () () _"Onward, my warriors! Move defty and quietly! Don't split up, however - we don't know, what dangers will await us in these tunnels."}

		{MESSAGE Krull () () _"Trolls know the look. Under our bridges, where we take toll, there they often are. They are nagas. Snake-women."}
		{MESSAGE Emborgi () () _"Are the senses failing me? How is it possible, that once a proud race of nagas settled under the ground? I remember times, when our kins made one, ruling the swamps and rivers on the whole continent."}
		{MESSAGE Aidala () () _"Greetings, sons of the west... Or should I say: sons of the north? This Person's name is Aidala. And these are my daughters. I'm their matriarch."}
		{MESSAGE Gewold () () _"Yuk... For years, nobody has seen any naga! You split off from the Horde! Some of you even tried to join the Northen Alliance, mating with tritons! Don't try to contradict, snake!"}
		{MESSAGE Marbus () () _"Gewold, go to hell! I reminder You, that it's me who is the Great Sovereign now! Be silent, when it comes to talking with someone, who got on our way!"}
		{MESSAGE Aidala () () _"Your companion's remark was spot-on, son of the north. The majority of my race would turn their backs on our tradition and the elders' beliefs. This Person, however, never got rid of her pride, never quenched the sorrow and hatred, that abound in her heart... And yet... This Person couldn't fight."}
		{MESSAGE Marbus () () _"Tell me, what has happened, lady."}
		{MESSAGE Aidala () () _"Less than one century ago, elders of my kin called a great meeting, on which we were supposed to debate, how to save This Person's race from defeat... But on the meeting we faced a betrayal. Young nagas, living in the most shallow waters, decided to join forces with the Nortern Alliance and murdered the vast majority of This Person's race. This person fought fiercely, killing many of her daughters and sisters, but she couldn't save the elders."}
		{MESSAGE Aidala () () _"I got sealed off with my most trusted daughters... The road to the sea was closed. And on land, crossbowmen were waiting for us. This Person could die a great, rightful death... However, it would cause that there wouldn't be any hatred between nagas and Northern Alliance anymore. Dwarves, elves and even The Great Kingdom of Wesnoth... Everyone would start equating This Person's race with something good. With something, that got rid of its darkness and joined them, to hunt pearls, help sailors and swim with dolphins."}
		{MESSAGE Aidala () () _"This Person couldn't stand that! This Person had to live, to hate. To give testimony of the darkness and decay, Testimony of the Snake. This Person had gathered its daughters and set off in the only dirrection where it could survive - to the caves. So here, in the darkness and gloom we've started to lay spawn, to grew stronger and wait for the moment when we could inflict deadly blow to our enemies. This Person presumes this moment have approached now."}
		{MESSAGE Marbus () () _"Your story is full of passion and darkness, my lady... The enemy that is pursuing us is even darker yet. I will welcome You and Your daughters in my ranks with joy."}
		{MESSAGE Gewold () () _"You should reconsider this... Not wanting to attack us does not make them our friends. They may betray us in the first suitable opportunity, joining that nagas, wchich are on the Northern Alliance side already."}
		{MESSAGE Aidala () () _"Sss... Quiet, ork... Be quiet or I will make you silent for ages... If it is needed this Person will make an oath. This Person swears on the stars and snakes, on the poison and swords, on the blood of black and red that it will serve your Great Sovereign and will give the whole of itself to him."}
		{MESSAGE Kochan () () _"Even in the face of the last events I must admit, my cousin, that it sounds pretty nice."}
		{MESSAGE Marbus () () _"I am glad that your humour is back, Kochan. As for the nagas... So be it. From now on you are my people as well. Together we must work our way out of this tunnels."}
		{MESSAGE Emborgi () () _"My hearth is full of joy knowing, that we will be fighting together with the water snakes. There are no creatures that are more stubborn, full of passion and hate born by this continent. Those features caused them not to leave this world into the cold hands of the death."}
		{MESSAGE Krull () () _"Trolls likes snakes. Let there is friendship between us."}
		{MESSAGE Aidala () () _"My Chieftain... Let me give you an advice... Underground midgets were also influenced by the Evil Spirit that devastates this lands. They are weak... Together we can face them and defeat them. But there is another way. Their guards are few, there are none on most of the corridors. We can reach east without being noticed if we will move carefully."}
		{MESSAGE Kochan () () _"That's a good advice. Personally I would rather not participate in the fight - terrain is not suitable for that."}
		{MESSAGE Gewold () () _"Quit babbling, Kochan! We require gold and supplies and there should be plenty in their fortifications! If we will not kill them now, they will emerge from the caves and attack us in the least expected moment. To avoid open war we must attack first!"}
		{MESSAGE Aidala () () _"My chieftain, this is not everything. This Person knows more... In the north, in the tunnels abbandoned by the midgets... I can feel magic vibrations from there... Me and my daughters think, that there can be hidden something that could prove useful in the future. It can even have the deciding touch in the final encounter."}
		{MESSAGE Krull () () _"Treasure! Trolls want that treasure! We not forgot, that trolls were good, when trolls had treasure!"}
		{MESSAGE Emborgi () () _"I also feel something magical... There is some arcane, powerful power... But different, not dwarvish. I think it may have something in common with the evil, that embraces the north. We should aquire this thing."}
		{MESSAGE Marbus () () _"Thank you all for your advices. Sylviana... Whatever I decide, I want you to be at my side. I am really glad that we've met. And now - onward!"}
