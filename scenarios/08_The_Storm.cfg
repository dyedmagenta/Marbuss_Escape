In the underground corridors, bodies of not only brave warriors, who always took the probability of death into account, but also dozens of women and children came to rest. During the last days of the march they was not a single family amongst the orcs that would not weep for the loss of someone close."

There was no wind underground, only overwhelming emptiness and tight hallways, which caused claustrophobia in saurians. If not for the iron fist of Emborgi-Tarash, many would succumb to madness. Only Nagas felt confident, sometimes leaving the group and traveling alone through milk-white, unpleasantly smelling underground rivers. They did not weep for their fallen sisters, they were like silent guardians of the Horde, only sometimes resurfacing their sinister-looking yet beautiful faces from the water. And even if they provided protection to the orcs, they instilled dread in them, and warriors being on guard duty near the underground lakes never allowed themselves to close their eyes."

Not until the third night, when the fog slightly raised and the light of the moon allowed to take a closer look at the surroundings, a shape of an ancient stone stronghold could be recognized.
