In the underground corridors, bodies of not only brave warriors, who always took the probability of death into account, but also dozens of women and children came to rest. During the last days of the march they was not a single family amongst the orcs that would not weep for the loss of someone close."

Those people were adapted to life on the vast swamp plains, where every gust of wind carried some new information; sometimes about the weather change, sometimes about incoming danger. There was no wind underground, only overwhelming emptiness and tight hallways, which caused claustrophobia in saurians. If not for the iron fist of Emborgi-Tarash, many would succumb to madness. Only Nagas felt confident, sometimes leaving the group and traveling alone through milk-white, unpleasantly smelling underground rivers. They did not weep for their fallen sisters, they were like silent guardians of the Horde, only sometimes resurfacing their sinister-looking yet beautiful faces from the water. And even if they provided protection to the orcs, they instilled dread in them, and warriors being on guard duty near the underground lakes never allowed themselves to close their eyes."

Not until the third night, when the fog slightly raised and the light of the moon allowed to take a closer look at the surroundings, a shape of an ancient stone stronghold could be recognized.

		{MESSAGE Kochan () () _"This is truly the end ... We have been surrounded, the siege is going to start now."}
		{MESSAGE Gewold () () _"Yes ... I would never have thought that I’d have the chance to command and army with a goblin. I must admit I have learned a lot about your race throughtout the journey and in the last battle. I must admit I even admire you. The way you mount wolves, how agile your are with a bow and an arrow. Remarkable!"}
		{MESSAGE Kochan () () _"It’s the same with you, Gewold. I would have never thought that I would be able to make friends with the mightiest warrior of the Great Horde. I had always thought your were drunkards who assault the weak. Now I see how wrong I was. You are able to fight with honour till you die, defending the ones you had promised to protect."}

		{MESSAGE Marbus () () _"I have found what we were looking for. And some other valuable stuff. It seems it’s not the time for explanation. We have to immediately head north, towards the woods."}
		{MESSAGE Gewold () () _"Marbus! I’m glad you came back. Nonetheless, as you can see yourself, we cannot meet your expectations. We’ve been surrounded, we cannot break through the ring of the undead. Maybe in the group of our best warriors ... But not with the old people, women and children ... Not to mention the food wagons."}
		{MESSAGE Kochan () () _"It’s not all true. Even though the ring oft he undead is closing down on us, their numbers stopped growing. We could send someone to distract the main forces oft he enemy and give the rest of us a chance to escape."}
		{MESSAGE Aidala () () _"This Person sees a glimmer of hope in this plan. The undead are not that smart. We may lock ourselves in the stronghold and wait out until the undead rush with all their forces after the unit which would head in the opposite direction to ours."}
		{MESSAGE Marbus () () _"No, I say no to it! I would have to send a few of my soldiers for a certain death?! This is pure madness, there must be another way!"}
		{MESSAGE Kochan () () _"There is no other way. We can’t wait any longer, too. So, it’s all settled."}
		{MESSAGE Marbus () () _"Cousin! What are you doing! I have not granted you permission! If you go, better be ready to face the consequences!"}
		{MESSAGE Kochan () () _"Forgive me, Marbus, but what cosequences there are for a dead man? Ido not expect to come back from this ride. It’s my decision. Respect it, please, and let’s part as friends."}
		{MESSAGE Gewold () () _"You really want to do this? Dying in battle is one thing, but such a sacrifice... In the whole history of all the clans, there have’t been many golbins who went down in the history so much, but I swear to you, if we survive this war, this what will happen to you, Kochan."}
		{MESSAGE Marbus () () _"I ...I don’t know what to say. You have supported me for years and helped me do the right things ... Without your advice ..."}
		{MESSAGE Kochan () () _"You have been doing well earlier, without my advice. You don’t need me anymore, cousin. You can perfectly take care of yourself. Now you have other people who will give you a hand when you are in need. It’s time for me to go, I’ve drawn the attention of the undead. Farewell, Marbus."}
