This settlement has guarded the bridge for decades. The next bridge like that is situated a couple of days’ march to the north. You have cut our way to Gelu'Aben!"}
		{MESSAGE Kochan () () _"Calm down, cousin. I cannot see any evidence of pillage. The food is still in the granaries. Not to mention the valuables. I doubt the reptiles have raided the homes of our brothers."}
 		{MESSAGE Ashuran () () _"The wolf raider is right, orcish lord. Almost a year ago, I and my brothers were banished by human mages from the swamps in the west. We stayed here. We were on good terms with the orcs from the settlement. Soon, trade between us started to flourish. We gave them medications and they gave us metals... Everything changed a month ago."}
 		{MESSAGE Ashuran () () _"It was a cold and foggy night, like all the nights during this winter. Our shamanesses had foreseen the coming of evil forces for a long time. Yet, what we saw was unspeakable... Ghosts emerged from the forests almost noiselessly. They had managed to murder a dozen of our warriors before the orcs realised they were being attacked. Chaos unleashed. Together with my best warriors, I rushed up the river to help your brothers, but when we reached the bridge..."}
 		{MESSAGE Marbus () () _"Continue, saurian leader..."}
 		{MESSAGE Ashuran () () _"One of the ghosts possessed the body of the orcish leader. He grabbed olive oil and torches. I saw it with my own eyes when he stepped in the middle of the bridge with insane smile on his face, poured the liquid onto himself and set it on fire ...... The bridge burned down shortly after him... We couldn't see much through the smoke. The screams of the dying could be heard until the dawn. A few of my veterans tried to swim across the river... None has returned."}
 		{MESSAGE Kochan () () _"Cousin, I've got a feeling the saurian is telling the truth. A few of my scouts found signs of their medications. We cannot let a pointless battle happen."}
 		{MESSAGE Marbus () () _"Yes, you are right, Kochan. Saurian! I and my warriors want to cross the river!"}
 		{MESSAGE Ashuran () () _"I fear it will be utterly hard, orc... Our oracle sensed evil coming from the south. Maybe we will manage to counter the undead together, though."}
 		{MESSAGE Marbus () () _"So be it. Those soulless creatures will pay a big price for killing our brothers. Let the women and children take all the food from the granaries while we kill the undead off."}
