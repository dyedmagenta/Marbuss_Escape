 			story = _"The Great Horde did not receive a warm welcome from the dwarven forces. Still, with the help of the nagas, they were able to repulse enemy attacks and force their way to the central part of the caves. Snake women proved to be irreplaceable when there was a need to wade through the flooded underground passes or to look for an alternative way through the marshy grounds. Those women were mysterious, deadly, their every movement and their way of being was filled with something mystical which fascinated some orcs and instil fear in hearts of others."
 		[/part]
 		[part]
 			story = _"Marbus himself was spending less and less time with his companions, instead he gathered around himself a small group of advisors, the greatest warriors and those who familiarized themselves with the culture and philosophy of dwarves. Their task was to choose the safest ways so as to evade encounters with much stronger enemy forces."
 		[/part]
 		[part]
 			story = _"The Gloom of this place had a grim impact on the clans’ connections. A few serious fights took place, some orcs died. The Culprits were quickly tracked down and judged by the Great Sovereign who, advised by Gewold, decided to make use of the war laws and ordered to hang them. After that, nagas dragged the bodies into underground rivers, and then covered them with rocks. Such death was the uttermost dishonour for an orc and his family. Knowing the price of disloyalty, the Horde did not have any more internal struggles from then on."
 		[/part]
 		[part]
 			story = _"On these grim days Aidala proved to be a real solace for Marbus. This Person was always ready to give him advice or lend an ear when he just needed to talk. It was unacceptable for some of his advisors who still didn't trust the nagas and were afraid of their way of life. However, with days passing, fewer and fewer people had an influence on the Great Sovereign’s decisions, who seemed to be getting older and more rigorous with every day. The journey through the undergrounds had such an influence on most of the orcs."
 		[/part]
 		[part]
 			story = _"Finally, the day came when the wanderers could feel the fresh breeze on their faces. They reached an underground lake that was the last thing separating them from the caves' exit. However, everyone knew that in such places dwarves very often set their settlements. Even without any proof of the danger ahead, Marbus ordered to prepare weapons."
