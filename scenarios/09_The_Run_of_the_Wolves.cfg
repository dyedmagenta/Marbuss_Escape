 			story = _"Our oldest memories all involve running away. Together with Marbus we were young then. We used to camp on the outskirts of Gelu’Aben, close to an old veteran’s tent. With some goblins we decided to steal his sword – it was an amazing Elvish blade, his war souvenir. He caught us red handed before we even managed to have a look around his tent. An then we started running, each of us in a different direction."

 			story = _"I was unlucky – it was me who he started to chase. He reeked of cheap booze, and his bloodshot eyes suggested that it would not end in screaming. I had to run. With my heart pounding, I rushed into the pen where the wolves were kept. The animals knew me well, even though I had never dared to touch any of them. Before I was born, my mother decided that I would become an archer, not a rider. Then it all changed."

		[/part]
 		[part]
 			story = _"I was scared. I was a young, terrified child who was running away from danger. I didn’t think that the wolves could also be dangerous. I lunged to Wilgar, quite a young pup which had been stopped being suckled a few months before. When I tell the story to anyone, they cannot believe that I wasn’t torn apart at that moment. I am wondering myself. Wilgar, however, knew what to do."
			background="story/landscape-mountains-04.webp"
		[/part]
 		[part]
 			story = _"When the drunk veteran rushed in the pen after me, the pup quickly darted past him and dashed into the forest with me. We were running away. Behind me I could only hear my persecutor’s a roar of surprise, and right after that a scream filled with pain. Later, I was in for a night in the forest. No one was looking for me, no one cared for a young goblin and a wolf pup. On that day the stars were shining brightly. I made a decision then that I would become a wolf rider. The fastest, the most agile and the bravest. I would do things no one, even Marbus, would dare to do!"
			background="story/landscape-mountains-04.webp"
		[/part]
 		[part]
 			story = _"Today I know I have done all those things. Wilgar died a few years after my cousin set up his own small clan. I mount its oldest son, Werg. I noticed fist white streaks in his fur. I've come to terms with such course of events. This matters not, because the moment came when I have to run away again. Run away to save others, to make the escape of my loved ones a success. I will buy them plenty of time. I will save them, even if my own escape ends in death."
