They were greeted with cheering, welcoming shorts and shouts of joy as well as with good wine and fare. It seemed the tension accompanying the warriors of the Great Horde had relieved, or at least decreased."

The elves agreed that the best solution would be to fight the Wild Gon at the foot of the Mountain of Destiny, one of the highest peaks in the north. The forces of Jarls, The Northern Alliance and Knalga united on the southern border where they had recently won a victory. All that had happened heralded the undead were going to attack with their full strength."

 			story = _"The elven plan was simple – Marbus was to summon The King of Gon at the foot of the Mountain of Destiny on farthest land north, behind which there was only the ice sea. He was to do it on when the undead attack the southern border. The summoned undead master would be accompanied only by the most loyal warriors, which would give the orcs the chance to ensure victory."

On the western border of The Northern Alliance rumour had it that few orcish troops had started to storm the local villages so as to increase the undead army’s numbers. Both the people and the elves sent their forces in order to stop the enemy, however, no unit came back."
