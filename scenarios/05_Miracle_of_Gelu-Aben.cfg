		{MESSAGE Marbus () () _"Hahaha... I'm glad that it's over now... But let’s get to the point... It's time we gathered the Horde. The undead are marching on us from the south... And judging from what you’ve said, they are also coming from the north... Let's send ravens to the chieftains..."}
		{MESSAGE Gewold () () _"The ravens were sent some time ago with a plea for help. As far as I know, only a few minors clans managed to survive."}
		{MESSAGE Kochan () () _"This is very unsettling news, cousin. It seems like we can't bargain either for more warriors or for a shelter."}
		{MESSAGE Marbus () () _"As for now, we have other worries. We must call the elders and hold a meeting."}
		{MESSAGE Gewold () () _"Calm down, warrior! First, let's take care of the bodies, patch up the wounded. The remaining survivors from Northern Alliance are fleeing in panic. Let's loot their camp and hold a feast!"}
		{MESSAGE Marbus () () _"For many days we have had no rest... So be it! Ragh for En Traht! We’ve won the battle!"}
		{MESSAGE Kochan () () _"Ragh for En Traht!"}
