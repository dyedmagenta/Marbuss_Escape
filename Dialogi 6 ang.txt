1. Dialog pocz¹tkowy.

Logo Wesnoth:
At last, Marbus's horde strided into the dark and dump dwarven corridors. Last of the orcs: oldsters and women, who dragged little carts with belongings and food, as well as a small livestock, such as goats and chickens, left behind the pale light of dawn. Now, their path would only be brighted by torches and phosphorescing fungi, which grow here and there, effusing a nasty, acrid smell. That's how their journey through the deeps begins.

Gewold:
Yuk! These mushrooms stink so terrible, that even our wargs start to yelp. I start to doubt in the point of our journey, Marbus. We are already going for few hours, and the tunnels are becoming narrower.

Krull Ska³a:
Shrooms stink and hurt. Hurt in belly. I eaten too much and now vomit.

Emborgi-tarash:
This type of mushrooms shouldn't stink... It looks like even here, beneath the ground, nature starts to feel the results of what is happening on the surface. Thus take a good look, orcish warriors! This is the best evidence of how strong is the ghost, who runs rampant on these lands.

Marbus:
Calm down, Gewold, or I will deem that you are becoming crusty due to the old age. There is no way back for us - we must move forward.

Kochan:
I must admit, however, that I feel unease as well, cousin. And it's not just about the tunnels, but about the lack of any traces of dwarves. I believed that we will force our way to the other side over their corpses, having a precisely determined path. If we get lost here, then neither starts, nor winds, nor wolves... Nothing will show us the way.

Krull Ska³a:
Trolls been living here for years and ages. I and my sons know, how to walk in gloom, to find way. When you get lost, we will lead.

Emborgi-tarash:
Can it be, that my blind eyes saw more, than yours? Seeing? You see, my kin isn't afraid of the darkness of this place. We will find a way, even if we will have to call our ancestors for assistance! And the ancestors of ours ancestors! And the ancestors of our ancestors' ancestors as well!

Marbus:
You see, then? We have nothing to be afraid of. Since when these undead appeared in the north, I feel like if an arcane force leadead us by the hand. Although it might be old' orcsess' superstition, I believe in the destiny. And death at this place isn't our destiny.

Gewold:
Silence! Calm down these wargs right now! Can you hear that? It's a sough of a river.

Kochan:
Thank forefathers! We will replenish our canteens and drink to our's fill, provided the waters is drinkable. It's also possible, that by the river will be found a dwarven settlement, so have yours swords ready.

Marbus:
Onward, my warriors! Move defty and quietly! Don't split up, however - we don't know, what dangers will await us in these tunnels.


2. Dialog po wynurzeniu siê nag.

Marbus:
What's that, for the ancestors!? Grab yours swords!

Krull Ska³a:
Trolls know the look. Under our bridges, where we take toll, there they often are. They are nagas. Snake-women.

Emborgi-tarash:
Are the senses failing me? How is it possible, that once a proud race of nagas settled under the ground? I remember times, when our kins made one, ruling the swamps and rivers on the whole continent.

Aidala:
Greetings, sons of the west... Or should I say: sons of the north? This Person's name is Aidala. And these are my daughters. I'm their matriarch.

Gewold:
Yuk... For years, nobody has seen any naga! You split off from the Horde! Some of you even tried to join the Northen Alliance, mating with tritons! Don't try to contradict, snake!

Marbus:
Gewold, go to hell! I reminder You, that it's me who is the Great Sovereign now! Be silent, when it comes to talking with someone, who got on our way!

Aidala:
Your companion's remark was spot-on, son of the north. The majority of my race would turn their backs on our tradition and the elders' beliefs. This Person, however, never got rid of her pride, never quenched the sorrow and hatred, that abound in her heart... And yet... This Person couldn't fight.

Marbus:
Tell me, what has happened, lady.

Aidala:
Less than one century ago, elders of my kin called a great meeting, on which we were supposed to debate, how to save This Person's race from defeat... But on the meeting we faced a betrayal. Young nagas, living in the most shallow waters, decided to join forces with the Nortern Alliance and murdered the vast majority of This Person's race. This person fought fiercely, killing many of her daughters and sisters, but she couldn't save the elders.

Aidala:
I got sealed off with my most trusted daughters... The road to the sea was closed. And on land, crossbowmen were waiting for us. This Person could die a great, rightful death... However, it would cause that there wouldn't be any hatred between nagas and Northern Alliance anymore. Dwarves, elves and even The Great Kingdom of Wesnoth... Everyone would start equating This Person's race with something good. With something, that got rid of its darkness and joined them, to hunt pearls, help sailors and swim with dolphins.

Aidala:
This Person couldn't stand that! This Person had to live, to hate. To give testimony of the  darkness and decay, Testimony of the Snake. This Person had gathered its daughters and set off in the only dirrection where it could survive - to the caves. So here, in the darkness and gloom we've started to lay spawn, to grew stronger and wait for the moment when we could inflict deadly blow to our enemies. This Person presumes this moment have approached now.

Marbus:
Your story is full of passion and darkness, my lady... The enemy that is pursuing us is even darker yet. I will welcome You and Your daughters in my ranks with joy.

Gewold:
You should reconsider this... Not wanting to attack us does not make them our friends. They may betray us in the first suitable opportunity, joining that nagas, wchich are on the Northern Alliance side already.

Aidala:
Sss... Quiet, ork... Be quiet or I will make you silent for ages... If it is needed this Person will make an oath. This Person swears on the stars and snakes, on the poison and swords, on the blood of black and red that it will serve your Great Sovereign and will give the whole of itself to him.

Kochan:
Even in the face of the last events I must admit, my cousin, that it sounds pretty nice.

Marbus:
I am glad that your humour is back, Kochan. As for the nagas... So be it. From now on you are my people as well. Together we must work our way out of this tunnels.

Emborgi-tarash:
My hearth is full of joy knowing, that we will be fighting together with the water snakes. There are no creatures that are more stubborn, full of passion and hate born by this continent. Those features caused them not to leave this world into the cold hands of the death.

Krull Ska³a:
Trolls likes snakes. Let there is friendship between us.

Aidala:
My Chieftain... Let me give you an advice... Underground midgets were also influenced by the Evil Spirit that devastates this lands. They are weak... Together we can face them and defeat them. But there is another way. Their guards are few, there are none on most of the corridors. We can reach east without being noticed if we will move carefully.

Kochan:
That's a good advice. Personally I would rather not participate in the fight - terrain is not suitable for that.

Gewold:
Gadan, Kochan! We require gold and supplies and there should be plenty in their fortifications! If we will not kill them now, they will emerge from the caves and attack us in the least expected moment. To avoid open war we must attack first!

Aidala:
My chieftain that is not all. This Person knows more... In the north, in the tunnels abbandoned by the midgets... I can feel magic vibrations from there... Me and my daughters think, that there can be hidden something that could prove useful in the future. It can even have the deciding touch in the final encounter.

Krull Ska³a:
Treasure! Trolls want that treasure! We not forgot, that trolls were good, when trolls had treasure!

Emborgi-tarash:
I also feel something magical... There is some arcane, powerful power... But different, not dwarvish. I think it may have something in common with the evil, that embraces the north. We should aquire this thing.

Marbus:
Thank you all for your adveces. Sylviana... Whatever I decide I want you to be at my side. I am really glad that we've met. And now - onward!


3. Zauwa¿a nas któryœ z krasnoludów.

Krasnolud:
For one thousand barrels of bear and a ton of pork! These are orcs! Blow into the horns! Orcs are attacking our lands!

Gewold:
Into the horns?! Somebody immediately start beating in drums! To the attack!

Marbus:
Silence, Gewold! And now, my Horde, start beating in drums! Slaughter them!

Aidala:
This Person sees, that orcish race hasn't changed since the last time she saw them.


4. Zabicie jednego z Krasnoludzkich W³adców.

Marbus:
Die, you dwarven monster! This is for all our warriors slain by your brethen!

Kochan:
Loot their strongholds soldiers! I am sure they have tons of gold and supplies in there!

---Po pokonaniu dowódcy gracz dostaje 100 z³ota.---


5. Zabicie drugiego Krasnoludzkiego W³adcy. Ten dialog pojawia siê niezale¿nie od tego, który to z w³adców. Mamy dwóch i mo¿emy ich pokonaæ naprzemiennie, ale ten wczeœniejszy dialog pojawia siê przy pokonaniu pierwszego (niezale¿nie od tego, który to z nich), a ten przy pokonaniu drugiego.

Marbus:
He's fallen! Dwarves run to their holes! We've aquired this glorious victory!

Gewold:
My sword shouts of excitation! Slain the rest! Kill everyone, take no prisoners!

Aidala:
This Person is glad, that the revenge is complete... With the gold from their treasuries we will grow stronger...

---Marbus dostaje 150 z³ota, ale scenariusz siê nie koñczy: musimy mieæ jeszcze opcjê zdobycia medalionu. Tak wiêc nasz cel misji, to dostanie siê Marbusem na wschodni skraj mapy.---

7. Dialog koñcowy, gdy Marbus ucieka niezauwa¿enie.

Marbus:
We made it. None of the dwarves noticed out pass. Well done, companions! Onward, into these caves!

Kochan:
I'm glad that we managed to avoid unneccessary fight. We must save our forces for more important battles.

Aidala:
Sss... This Person would prefer to behead every dwarf, rather than let them live. Hatred to them is burning in our blood. But we will do what is neccesary.

8. Dialog koñcowy, gdy Marbus ucieka po alarmie.

Marbus:
Quickly, my Horde, to these tunnels!

Gewold:
What!? We are fleeing now, after they battle already started!?

Aidala:
This Person could dip her blade in the bodies of these, whom she hates! Why do we have to interrupt such a sweet for This Person moment?

Marbus:
Stop arguing with me! Move on, deeper into the cavern! Remember, that our goal isn't a fight with dwarves, but getting into the other side of the mountains!

9A. Dialog koñcowy, gdy Marbus dociera do wschodniego krañca mapy, ale zabi³ wczeœniej wszystkich krasnoludów.

Marbus:
Our opponents are dead. We achieved a great victory over here. But I'm worried that soon, all nearby dwarven clans will find out about this massacre. They will seek revenge.

Kochan:
This indeed might become a big problem. Still, we aren't able to prevent it anymore. All what's left for us is to count of the destiny and follow the path, like we did so far.

Gewold:
What are you talking about!? I rejoice, that we vanquished our opponents! We should open barrels of beer and feast!

Aidala:
This Person thinks, that staying here would be irresonable. We should rather move as soon as possible, to leave these caves.

Marbus:
I agree with Your words, Aidala. Get ready to march off! We are leaving this place!

Marbus:
My subordinates have detected strange magic aroud you. We are in the situation in which we can use any magic to help us. We are running from the undead that had started to harass the north. Help us, if you are able to, ghost.

Duch Starego Orka:
Running...? So the pride orcish race runs from the undead souls...? Again...

Aidala:
Again? This Person thinks, that you know more than you seem to. Everything that is happening now in the north - Had this happened earlier?

Duch Starego Orka:
. . .

Marbus:
I beg you, ghost! Know, that I am the Great Souverein of the Horde now... I have the power to command you! Answer us!

Duch Starego Orka:
Yes... It had happened already... But not here. In the far, far west... When the dark Wesfolk people stood in front of us tearing us out from our battle-realm... Our primal world from which we were summoned by the liches.

Duch Starego Orka:
The old portals were opened, we used them to enter this world... This is not the end of the story... We were betrayed... Lich Lords found out how powerfull we are... They could not kept us in their grasp as long as their portals were opened... They used all of their power and knowledge to close them. Terrible and mighty were the spells that are on this world no more and never will be again unless the second sun shines over the continent.

Duch Starego Orka:
Portals were closed and the way to our home was lost. Before it happened there was something more that managed to get here from our wolrd... The name of that thing is now forgotten but it makes the sleep, the food and even the females unable to satisfy the lust for blood that we feel. This thing haunts the north now.

Aidala:
Ancient is this story of yours, ghost... This Person dares to ask... How can we stop that what is happening now?

We've tried many things to turn the unstoppable river of the destiny around... Nothing can change the faith... Go away! I've told you enough already... Be gone and die as you like!
